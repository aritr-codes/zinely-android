# V2 frozen-spec defect register

> **What this owns:** defects found *in the frozen V2 design artifacts* during Compose implementation —
> contradictions, stale text, omissions, and disagreements between two frozen files.
>
> **What it does not own:** implementation bugs (those are code review findings), design changes (those
> are owner amendments to the freeze), or deviations *from* the spec (those are logged in the PR and the
> relevant ADR).

## Why this register exists

The [implementation rules](../COMPOSE-IMPLEMENTATION-RULES.md) say that when a frozen artifact itself
looks wrong, the implementer **stops and raises it** rather than editing Compose around it or quietly
"correcting" the design. That rule produces findings that belong to the *design corpus*, not to any one
code change — and before this file existed they had nowhere to live, which meant the only ways to record
one were to bury it in an unrelated ADR or to let it evaporate.

Entries here are **not blockers by default.** A defect is logged, classified, and left for the design
corpus to clean up. If one genuinely blocks implementation, that is stated explicitly in its row and the
work stops until an owner ruling lands.

## How to use it

- One entry per defect. State what the artifact says, why it is wrong, and whether implementation depends
  on it.
- **Never fix the frozen artifact from an implementation session.** Amending a frozen surface is an owner
  act ([V2-CONSTITUTION.md §VI](V2-CONSTITUTION.md)); this register is the queue that feeds it.
- When an entry is resolved, mark it Resolved with the commit that cleaned it up. Do not delete it — the
  record of what was once contradictory is what stops it being reintroduced.

### D-001 — `v2-bench.html` header contradicts the freeze record

| | |
|---|---|
| **Artifact** | [`docs/design/mockups/v2-bench.html`](mockups/v2-bench.html), header comment |
| **Found** | 2026-07-28, during Phase A / A1 (independent review of the V2 chrome palette) |
| **Severity** | Documentation defect — **does not block implementation** |
| **Status** | Open |

**What it says.** The file's own header makes both claims, nine lines apart:

- line 3 — `Zinely V2 — the Bench (Editor) — canonical HTML prototype. 🔒 DESIGN FROZEN 2026-07-28 (owner-approved; V2-BENCH-REVIEW.md §E.6).`
- line 10 — `NOT frozen. For owner critique.`

**Why it is wrong.** Line 10 is stale text carried over from the pre-freeze critique revision; the freeze
commit did not strip it. The freeze is real and is the operative status: commit
`4494e95 docs(v2): Bench (Editor) — 🔒 DESIGN FREEZE (owner-approved 2026-07-28)` is the last commit to
touch the file and **is an ancestor of `main`**, the working tree is clean, and
[COMPOSE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md §3](../COMPOSE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md) records the Bench as frozen at
that commit. Line 3 is correct; line 10 should be deleted.

**Does implementation depend on it?** No. The Bench's `:root` token block — the part A1 consumed, and the
part [ADR-071](../DECISIONS.md#adr-071) makes canonical for shared V2 implementation tokens — is
unambiguous regardless of which header line a reader believes. A1 proceeded on that basis.

**Why it still matters.** The Bench is the single most-read spec in the remaining programme: it is the
canonical source for shared implementation tokens (ADR-071 §2) and the whole authority for Phase C. A file
that tells a fresh session it is "for owner critique" invites exactly the reinterpretation the freeze
exists to prevent — and the risk grows as Phase C reads it more heavily. Clean it up in the design corpus
before Phase C begins.

**Owner disposition (2026-07-28):** *"Correctly identified. Do not modify the implementation. Instead, log
it as a documentation defect against the design repository… No implementation work depends on resolving
it, but it should be cleaned up in the design corpus."*

### D-002 — two frozen cover inks put their titles below AA for normal text

| | |
|---|---|
| **Artifact** | [`docs/design/mockups/v2-library.html`](mockups/v2-library.html) lines 68, 79-82 |
| **Found** | 2026-07-28, during Phase A / A2 (modelling the `content.*` namespace) |
| **Severity** | Accessibility question — **does not block A2**; owner ruling owed before Phase B's gate |
| **Status** | Open — **owner ruling requested** |

**Measured.** The cover title (`.ct`, `color` from the ink class) against its own ink fill:

| Cover ink | Title on fill | vs 4.5:1 | vs 3.0:1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Matcha `#F7F2E7` on `#7C8A3F` | **3.380:1** | ✗ fails | ✓ passes |
| Teal `#F7F2E7` on `#47857B` | **3.832:1** | ✗ fails | ✓ passes |
| Strawberry `#4A211F` on `#E27F89` | 4.992:1 | ✓ | ✓ |
| Ochre `#3A2A0E` on `#D19A3C` | 5.535:1 | ✓ | ✓ |
| Paper stock `#2A251E` on `#F1EBDA` | 12.763:1 | ✓ | ✓ |

**The question.** Which floor applies to a cover title? It is genuinely ambiguous, and the ambiguity
is in the corpus rather than in the reading:

- `.ct` is `font-size:1.16rem; font-weight:600` — about **18.56px semibold**. WCAG's large-text
  threshold is **18.66px bold**. The title falls just under on *both* counts (0.1px of size, and
  semibold rather than bold), so treating it as large text is a stretch rather than a fact.
- If it is **normal** text, the floor is 4.5:1 and **Matcha and Teal fail**.
- But cover inks carry **no ★** in [V2-TOKENS.md](V2-TOKENS.md), and
  [V2-CONSTITUTION.md](V2-CONSTITUTION.md) §III gates AA specifically on *"the ★-marked pairings"* —
  under which reading no CI floor is owed for cover inks at all.
- Yet [COMPOSE-V2-ROADMAP.md](../COMPOSE-V2-ROADMAP.md) Phase B lists **"AA contrast per ink"** among
  the impl-gates that must be met, without naming a level.

So three governing documents point three ways, which is why this is logged rather than decided.

**What implementation did, pending the ruling.** `ZinelyContentInksTest` asserts the **3.0:1** floor —
the minimum defensible gate. This is deliberately *not* a resolution: it is strictly better than no
gate (a genuine regression still fails the build), while refusing to certify at 4.5:1 a pair that does
not clear it. **No frozen value was changed**, and no ink was quietly excluded to make the suite green.

**Why it should not be settled by implementation.** Every available fix is a design change: darken the
two ink fills, lighten their title colour, or raise the title's size/weight past the large-text
threshold. All three alter what the shelf looks like, so all three are owner amendments to the frozen
Library — [COMPOSE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md §4](../COMPOSE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md)'s golden rule
applies: if the HTML is wrong, the HTML is fixed first.

**Owner decision requested:** which floor governs cover titles, and if 4.5:1, which of the three fixes
should the frozen Library adopt? Needed before Phase B's *"AA contrast per ink"* gate can be assessed.

### D-003 — the maker palette is ten inks or nineteen, depending on which document you read

| | |
|---|---|
| **Artifacts** | [`v2-bench.html`](mockups/v2-bench.html) lines 391-394, 460, 463-470 · [V2-CONSTITUTION.md](V2-CONSTITUTION.md) §III · [V2-IDENTITY.md](V2-IDENTITY.md) §4 · [V2-BENCH-REVIEW.md](V2-BENCH-REVIEW.md) §H4 |
| **Found** | 2026-07-28, during Phase A / A2 (independent review of the `content.*` namespace) |
| **Severity** | **Specification conflict** — did not block A2; would have blocked the Phase C ink popover |
| **Status** | ✅ **RESOLVED** 2026-07-28 by owner ruling — see the resolution at the end of this entry |

**The conflict.** Four governing documents describe the maker's palette, and they do not describe the
same thing.

| Source | What it says the maker palette is |
|---|---|
| [V2-BENCH-REVIEW.md](V2-BENCH-REVIEW.md) §H4 (the directive that created it) | *"**~12–18 named inks** in three bands (**inks** · **paper tints** · **neutrals**)"* |
| **The frozen `v2-bench.html`** (the implementation of that directive) | **19 swatches in three bands** — `INKS` (10) + `TINTS` (5) + `NEUT` (4), plus 3 presets |
| [V2-IDENTITY.md](V2-IDENTITY.md) §4 | *"The **10** named riso spot inks the Bench already froze are the source of truth — **verbatim, no invention**"* — and enumerates exactly the `INKS` band |
| [V2-CONSTITUTION.md](V2-CONSTITUTION.md) §III | *"Maker inks (the **10-ink** Bench H4 set)"* — inherited from Identity |

The frozen prototype is unambiguous about behaviour: `bandHTML('Inks',INKS)+bandHTML('Paper
tints',TINTS)+bandHTML('Neutrals',NEUT)` (`:460`) renders all three bands, and `applyInk`
(`:463-470`) is bound to **every** `.sw2` swatch — so a maker can apply any of the nineteen as an ink.
The Constitution and Identity describe that same set as ten.

**Why this is not self-reconciling.** The 4-vs-10 puzzle between V2-TOKENS.md and the Constitution
*was* reconciled elsewhere in the corpus ([V2-BENCH-REVIEW.md](V2-BENCH-REVIEW.md) §8 — cover inks and
in-page inks are distinct axes), and A2 followed that ruling. The same search was run for this one and
the candidate reconciler makes it **worse, not better**: V2-IDENTITY.md §4 groups the ten *"for study
into four bands — greens & earth · warm · cool · neutral"*, which is a **different banding** from the
prototype's three, and then says *"any future widening is a Bench-H4 decision, not an Identity one"* —
pointing authority back at the Bench, which has already widened to nineteen. So Identity simultaneously
fixes the set at ten and delegates widening to a document that shows nineteen.

**Three concrete values have no token home.** The `NEUT` band contains `Slate #5B5347`,
`Stone #8C8269` and `Fog #B7AD93`. None appears in [V2-TOKENS.md](V2-TOKENS.md) or V2-IDENTITY.md's
enumeration. Note that Slate and Stone are byte-identical to light-theme chrome `--ink-soft` and
`--ink-faint` — so if they *are* content inks, the chrome/content wall has two sanctioned crossings
beyond the already-known `Ink #2A251E`, and any future "no content value equals a chrome value" lint
must know that up front. `TINTS` similarly contains `Cream #F1E9D6`, which is close to but **not** the
cover stock `#F1EBDA` — near-misses like that are exactly what a token audit exists to catch.

**What implementation did, pending the ruling.** A2 models **only the `INKS` band** — the ten the
Constitution and Identity name verbatim. This is the smallest defensible claim: porting all nineteen
would contradict the Constitution, and treating ten as complete would contradict the frozen prototype,
so the field is documented as *one band of three* and `ZinelyContentInks.makerInks` carries an explicit
"do not read this as the maker's supplies — read D-003 first" warning for the Phase C session.

**✅ RESOLUTION — owner ruling, 2026-07-28.**

> *"The frozen HTML is the authority. The complete maker palette consists of: **Inks · Paper Tints ·
> Neutrals**. The constitutional '10 maker inks' refers only to the INKS band. Paper Tints and Neutrals
> are **separate categories, not additional inks**. Do not merge them. Do not rename them. Implement all
> three groups exactly as frozen when Phase C arrives. Model them as three distinct collections so the
> architecture reflects the product language rather than flattening everything into a single list."*

Neither document was wrong; the question was miscast. The Constitution's "10 maker inks" was never a
claim about the size of the palette — it names **one band within it**. "Ten inks" and "nineteen
swatches" are both true because *ink* is a category, not a synonym for *swatch*.

**Implemented** in [`ZinelyContentInks`](../../core/ui/src/main/kotlin/com/aritr/zinely/ui/theme/ZinelyContentInks.kt)
as `makerInks` / `paperTints` / `neutrals` — three collections of three **distinct types**, which is
what makes "do not merge them" enforceable rather than merely written down: there is no `List<Color>`
the three can be concatenated into, so flattening the palette is a compile error. Recorded as
[ADR-072](../DECISIONS.md#adr-072) Decision 6. The three `PRESETS` are recipes over the bands rather
than tokens and remain Phase C's.

**Two things this surfaced that outlive the defect**, both now pinned by test:

- **Three sanctioned chrome/content value coincidences.** Neutral `Ink #2A251E`, `Slate #5B5347` and
  `Stone #8C8269` are byte-identical to light chrome `ink`, `inkSoft` and `inkFaint`. A future "no
  content value equals a chrome value" lint would therefore be **wrong**; the only value-level rule the
  corpus states is the `consequence` exclusion.
- **`Ink` legitimately appears in two bands** (spot ink *and* neutral), verbatim from source — pinned so
  it is never de-duplicated into one, which would silently change what the popover offers.
